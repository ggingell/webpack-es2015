# ES2015 + JSX via Gulp, Babel & Webpack

This project is designed to be a starting point for React and ES2015 projects.

## Install Gulp

`$ npm install -g gulp`

Installing Gulp this way allows you to use Gulp via the command line.

## Developing

`$ gulp`

Start the Webpack Dev Server and watch src/**. Use this at the start of your dev workflow.

`$ gulp build`

Build the project into `dist`.

## Install NVM

This is optional but highly recommended since Node's compatibilty varies highly between versions. See install instructions here: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

Then run `$ nvm use` in this repo's root directory whenever you enter with a new shell session.
